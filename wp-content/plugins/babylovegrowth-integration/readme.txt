Secure REST endpoint to publish posts from BabyLoveGrowth.ai backend via API key.

== Description ==

BabyLoveGrowth Integration adds a secure REST API endpoint to your WordPress site so BabyLoveGrowth.ai can publish or update posts remotely. It uses an API key you control in WordPress settings, and supports featured images and HTML/Markdown content.

- Improved Authorization
- Endpoints: `GET /wp-json/babylovegrowth/v1/ping`, `POST /wp-json/babylovegrowth/v1/publish`
- Accepts `title`, `slug`, `content_html` or `content_markdown`, optional `metaDescription`, `heroImageUrl`, `status`
- Sets/updates posts by slug; supports `publish`, `draft`, `pending`

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/babylovegrowth-integration` directory, or upload the ZIP via Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings → BabyLoveGrowth Integration. Copy the API Key.
4. In BabyLoveGrowth, configure the Webhook Integration with the Bearer token. Endpoint base is your site URL, e.g. `https://example.com/wp-json/babylovegrowth/v1/publish`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
